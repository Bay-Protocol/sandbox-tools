# Percentage of the max bid that the bot will bid
# NOTE: collateral auctions have a forward and reverse phase. Bidding 'max_bid' will trigger the auction to enter reverse phase. Bidding the max_bid is generally a significant discount to the underlying collateral value. For example, if $150 of collateral was backing $100 in debt, max_bid would be ~$100. If the value of the collateral has decreased by 10% due to market volatility, bidding max_bid and winning would have an expected value of $135. Theoretically, lower values of this parameter should result in winning fewer auctions. If this is set below one, the bot will never make bids on collateral auctions in the reverse phase
FORWARD_BID_MAX="1"

# Note, margin is determined by querying the Binance v3 exchange API for the current spot price of the collateral asset. If Binance is not responding, CoinGecko is used as a backup.

# the minimum expected margin (as a percentage) for placing a forward bid
# Example: Setting this to 0.1 is the equivalent of saying only bid $100 if the current value of the collateral is $110.
# Theoretically, higher values of this parameter should result in fewer winning auctions.
FORWARD_BID_MARGIN="0.05"

# the minimum expected margin (as a percentage) for placing a reverse bid
# Example: Setting this to 0.1 is the equivalent of saying only accept lots that are currently worth $110 if the bid is at or below $100
# Theoretically, higher values of this parameter should result in fewer winning  auctions
